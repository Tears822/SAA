To proceed with implementing the Survey and MyTasks features, I'll need SharePoint access to test and integrate the web parts with your environment. Since I don't currently have a SharePoint account, could you please create an account for me or provide access credentials? I'll need the SharePoint site URL where these features will be deployed, Site Owner or Site Collection Administrator permissions to test in the workbench and configure list structures for survey data storage, and access to the existing MyTasks list structure to understand the current data model. Once I have this access, I can begin testing and integration work immediately.
