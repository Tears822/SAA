I understand the original deadline, and I want to be transparent about the timeline. I spent significant time fixing critical build errors that were preventing the project from running at all - resolving 80+ TypeScript compilation errors related to DevExtreme type definitions and getting the development environment properly configured. While this delayed the feature development, it was necessary foundational work that ensures the Survey and MyTasks features will build and deploy correctly. Now that the project is stable, I can proceed with implementation, but I'll need a realistic timeline to deliver quality work. Would it be possible to adjust the deadline, or would you prefer I prioritize getting a working prototype ready as quickly as possible?
