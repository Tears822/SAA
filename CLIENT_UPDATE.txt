I've successfully resolved all the critical build errors that were preventing the project from compiling. The main issue was that the project was using outdated type definitions for the DevExtreme component library, which caused over 80 TypeScript compilation errors. I fixed this by updating all the type references, adding proper imports across 11 web part files, and configuring the TypeScript setup to work with the current DevExtreme version. The project now builds successfully with zero errors and is ready for SharePoint integration testing. I've also set up the development environment so we can test the web parts once we have SharePoint access.
