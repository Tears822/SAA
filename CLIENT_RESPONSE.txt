I'll need to create a new Survey web part component with star rating controls and implement the MyTasks enhancements with DevExtreme DataGrid sorting and filtering capabilities. I'll also need to set up the SharePoint list structures for survey data storage and configure the data models to match your existing task management schema. Once I have SharePoint access, I can test the integration with your actual lists, verify the authentication flow, and ensure the survey submission and task filtering work correctly with your data structure.
