I understand you'd like the Survey feature completed within an hour, but I want to set realistic expectations. The Survey implementation requires building a new web part component with custom star rating controls, setting up the SharePoint list structure for data storage, implementing validation logic, and testing the integration - which typically takes several hours of development work. Additionally, I'll need SharePoint access to test and verify everything works correctly with your environment. Would it be possible to extend the timeline to allow for proper development and testing, or would you prefer I focus on getting the core functionality working first and then refine it?
