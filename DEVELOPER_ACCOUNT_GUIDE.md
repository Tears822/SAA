# Using Developer SharePoint Account for Tasks

## ✅ What You CAN Do with Developer Account

### For Survey Task (Task A):
- ✅ Create and test the Survey web part completely
- ✅ Set up SharePoint list structure for survey data
- ✅ Test all functionality (star ratings, validation, submission)
- ✅ Verify data storage and retrieval
- ✅ Test authentication flow
- ✅ Complete development and testing

### For MyTasks Task (Task B):
- ✅ Build sorting and filtering functionality
- ✅ Test DevExtreme DataGrid features
- ✅ Create a test MyTasks list with sample data
- ✅ Verify all UI interactions work correctly

## ⚠️ What You'll Still Need from Client

### For MyTasks Specifically:
- Access to their actual MyTasks list structure to understand:
  - Column names and types
  - Data format
  - Existing relationships
- This ensures the enhancements match their current setup

## Recommendation

**Yes, create a developer account!** It will allow you to:
1. Complete the Survey task fully (100%)
2. Build and test MyTasks enhancements (90% - you'll just need to align with their actual list structure later)

You can start development immediately while waiting for client SharePoint access for final integration.
